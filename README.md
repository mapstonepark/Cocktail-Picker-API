# Cocktail Maker API
 

My first API project where users can input the alcohol of their choice and get a recipe, image and shopping list for several drink options

## How It's Made:
This site is made using a cocktail API from The Cocktail DB.com

## Lessons Learned:
How to use APIs online to grab information from a server. First major win and that excitment sparked a huge love for coding!
